# The severity of Fatimah's anger

**Allah (swt):** \
Indeed, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. \
`Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 57`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Fatimah is a part of me and her wrath is my wrath. \
`Bukhari 3714` `Muslim 6202`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Allah gets angry by your anger and gets pleased by your pleasure. \
`Mustadrak, vol 3, page 153`

# Fatimah's anger towards Abu Bakr. Could it have been unreasonable?

Abu Bakr told Fatimah about the hadith of inheritance, but she never accepted, so we are left with two choices:
1. Fatimah was being unreasonable
2. Abu Bakr made it up

If Fatimah was an unreasonable person, The Prophet (pbuh) would not have said such wonderful things about her:

**Allah (swt):** \
And he does not speak out of desire. \
`Surah an-Najm, ayah 3`

Now, onto how angry she was with Abu Bakr:

**Fatimah:** \
By Allah, I will complain to Allah about you. \
`Ansab al-Ashraf, vol 3, page 316` `Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

**Fatimah:** \
By Allah, I will not speak to you again. \
`Ansab al-Ashraf, vol 3, page 316` `Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

Fatimah was angered by Abu Bakr and did not speak to him until her death. \
`Bukhari 3093`

Fatimah left in her will that Abu Bakr may not pray upon her, so she was buried nightly, and Abbas ibn Abd-ul-Mutallib prayed. \
`Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

Ali buried Fatimah nightly without informing Abu Bakr. \
`Bukhari 4240`

# Abu Bakr couldn't have been the Imam of the time

Fatimah never went under the bay'ah of Abu Bakr. If Abu Bakr was the Imam of the time, then that means she died a death of kufr! How can that be, when The Prophet of Allah (pbuh) has said Fatimah is a part of her?

Whoever has not recognized the Imam of his time, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Muslim, vol 8, page 107`

Whoever has died, without having an Imam, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 4, page 96` `Mustadrak, vol 1, page 77 and page 117` `Mu'jam al-Kabir, vol 10, page 350, hadith 10687` `Sahih Ibn Haban, number 44`

Whoever has died, and is not under a bay'ah, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Sunan Bayhaqi, vol 8, page 156-157`

Since Fatimah never spoke to Abu Bakr and again and said that she will complain to Allah about him, she couldn't have considered him as her Imam. So who was the Imam of Fatimah?
