# The severity of Fatima's anger

**Allah (swt):** \
Indeed, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. \
`Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 57`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Fatima is a part of me and her wrath is my wrath. \
`Bukhari 3714` `Muslim 6202`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Allah gets angry by your anger and gets pleased by your pleasure. \
`Mustadrak, vol 3, page 153`

# Fatima's anger towards Abu Bakr. Could it have been unreasonable?

Abu Bakr told Fatima about the hadith of inheritance, but she never accepted, so we are left with two choices:
1. Fatima was being unreasonable
2. Abu Bakr made it up

If Fatima was an unreasonable person, The Prophet (pbuh) would not have said such wonderful things about her:

**Allah (swt):** \
And he does not speak out of desire. \
`Surah an-Najm, ayah 3`

Now, onto how angry she was with Abu Bakr:

**Fatima:** \
By Allah, I will complain to Allah about you. \
`Ansab al Ashraf, vol 3, page 316` `Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

**Fatima:** \
By Allah, I will not speak to you again. \
`Ansab al Ashraf, vol 3, page 316` `Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

Fatima was angered by Abu Bakr and did not speak to him until her death. \
`Bukhari 3093`

Fatima left in her will that Abu Bakr may not pray upon her, so she was buried nightly, and Abbas ibn Abd-ul-Mutallib prayed. \
`Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

Ali buried Fatimah nightly without informing Abu Bakr. \
`Bukhari 4240`

Abu Bakr wrote Fatima a document of ownership over Fadak, Umar saw and asked what it was, and Abu Bakr answered, so Umar said: How are you going to suffice the people if they rise against you? So Umar took it from Fatima and ripped it up. \
`As Sirat ul Halabiyah, vol 3, page 488` `Falak un Nijah fil Imamah was Salah, page 160`

# Abu Bakr couldn't have been the Imam of the time

Fatima never went under the bay'ah of Abu Bakr. If Abu Bakr was the Imam of the time, then that means she died a death of kufr! How can that be, when The Prophet of Allah (pbuh) has said Fatima is a part of her?

Whoever has not recognized the Imam of his time, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Muslim, vol 8, page 107`

Whoever has died, without having an Imam, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 4, page 96` `Mustadrak, vol 1, page 77 and page 117` `Mu'jam al-Kabir, vol 10, page 350, hadith 10687` `Sahih Ibn Haban, number 44`

Whoever has died, and is not under a bay'ah, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Sunan Bayhaqi, vol 8, page 156-157`

Since Fatima never spoke to Abu Bakr again and said that she will complain to Allah about him, she couldn't have considered him as her Imam. So who was the Imam of Fatimah?

# Umar's attack on Fatima

Ali and Zubayr were in the house of Fatima, and when the news of this reached Umar, he came and said: O daughter of The Messenger of Allah! The dearest person to us is your father, and after him, you. But, By Allah, this will not prevent me from commanding your house to be set on fire, if this gathering (Ali and Zubayr) is ever repeated. Fatima said: By Allah, he will do what he said. \
`Musannaf, vol 8, page 572`

Umar came to the house of Fatima and said: By Allah, I will set this house on fire if they do not come out and give bay'ah. Zubayr came out with his sword but he slipped and fell and his sword was taken. \
`Tarikh Tabari, vol 2, page 443`

Abu Bakr commanded Umar to take Ali, for bay'ah, Umar went to Fatima's house with a fire. Fatima, from behind the door, asked: O son of Khattab! Is it you who wishes to burn my house down? Umar responded: Yes, this will strengthen what your father brought. \
`Ansab al Ashraf, vol 1, page 586`

Abu Bakr command Umar to take them out of their home, and if they resisted, to go to war with them, Umar went to her house with a flame. Fatima asked: O son of Khattab, is the fire that you have brought, to burn my house down? He said: Yes, unless you do what the Ummah has done. \
`Aqd ul Farid, vol 3, page 63` `Tarikh Abul Fada, vol 1, page 156`

Abu Bakr sent Umar to get bay'ah from those who had rejected him, who were staying at Fatima's house. Umar told them to come out but they rejected. Umar requested firewood and said: By Allah, either come out or I will burn down this house and whoever is inside it. He was told Fatima is inside, he said even if Fatimah is inside! \
`A'lam an Nisa, vol 4, page 114`

Umar said: If you do not give bay'ah, I will set the house on fire and I will not free anyone inside it, even if the daughter of The Mustafa is among them! \
`Diwan Muhammad Hafiz Ibrahim, vol 1, page 82`

They set her house on fire and caused Muhsin to be miscarried. \
`Isbat ul Wasiyah, page 143`

On the day of bay'ah, Umar hit Fatima and caused Muhsin to be miscarried.\
`Al Wafi bil Wafiyat, vol 5, page 347`

Umar kicked Fatimah and caused Muhsin to be miscarried. \
`Lisan ul Mizan, by Ibn Hajar, vol 1, page 268`
> Ibn Hajar rejects this hadith by saying Ibn Abi Darim, the person who narrated this, is from Rawafidh, but he is described in Siyar A'lam an Nubala (vol 15, page 576 and vol 9, page 555) as being a virtuous Imam with a good memory and all of the six sahih books narrate from him. So either the sahih books aren't actually sahih, or Umar caused Fatimah to miscarry!

Umar said: By Allah, come out or I will burn this house upon it's residents. He was told Fatimah is inside, he said even if Fatimah is inside! Umar first knocked, then proceeded to kick the door down. Fatimah was yelling out: O father! O Prophet of Allah! \
`Al Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, vol 1, page 192-193, and vol 4, page 274-277`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
When I saw Fatima, I remembered an event that will happen to her, her right taken away from her, her ribs broken, her child miscarried, while she is yelling out 'Wa Muhammadah!' (calling out to her father), but no one responds to her. She will be the first of my kinsmen to join me, and she will meet me while she is deeply saddened and martyred. O Allah, curse whoever wronged her, punish who took away her right, and humiliate who has humiliated her, and give eternal hellfire to who shattered her ribs and murdered her unborn child. Angels say Ameen. \
`Fara'id us Simtain, vol 2, page 34-35`

**Allah (swt):** \
Indeed, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. \
`Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 57`

# Umar would condemn The Prophet (pbuh) and would command him to do things another way!

Abu Hurayrah went to The Prophet (pbuh) and The Prophet (pbuh), while giving him his shoes, said: Take this and go, and if you saw anyone saying "La Ilaha Illallah" while he believes it in his heart, tell him that he'll be in Jannah! On his way, he saw Umar, and Umar asked him what the shoes are for, and he said what The Prophet (pbuh) had told him, so Umar hit Abu Hurayrah causing him to fall hard to the ground, and told him to go back. So Abu Hurayrah went back to The Prophet (pbuh) while crying, and he asked him what was wrong, and Abu Hurayrah explained, so The Prophet (pbuh) asked Umar why he did as such, and Umar said: Don't give anyone the good news of Jannah, because they'll think this is enough for them and that they do not need to do good deeds anymore. \
`Muslim, vol 1, page 59`

Umar took The Prophet (pbuh) by his shirt and said: Hasn't Allah forbidden you from praying for Munafiqin? The Prophet (pbuh) ignored him. \
`Muslim, vol 8, page 120`

# Umar would urinate while standing

**Umar:** \
The Prophet saw me while I was peeing while standing, and told me not to do it while standing. \
`Sunan Tirmidhi, vol 1, page 18`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Among the betrayals (to oneself) is to pee while standing. \
`Umdat ul Qari, vol 3, page 135`

# Umar would disobey The Quran by skipping prayers

**Allah (swt):** \
If you do not find water, then purify yourself with clean dirt. \
`Surah an-Nisa, ayah 43`

**Umar:** \
If I don't find water, I will not pray. \
`Sunan Abi Dawud, vol 1, page 81` `Sunan Nisa'i, vol 1, page 168` `Musannaf, vol 1, page 238-239` `Sunan al Kubra, vol 1, page 133` `Mu'jam al Kabir, vol 9, page 314` `Umdat ul Qari, vol 4, page 19` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 9, page 588`

# Umar would recite Al-Fatiha incorrectly, even in Salah!

Correct: **Sirat alladhina** an'amta alayhim ghayr-il-maghdubi alayhim **wa la-dhallin** \
Umar would always recite like this: **Sirata man** an'amta alayhim ghayri-il-maghdhubi alayhim **ghayr-idh-dhallina alayhim wa ghayr-adh-dhallin** \
`Masahif, by Ibn Abi Dawud, vol 1, page 284-286` \
(Ibn Abi Dawud and Ibn Athir have said this hadith has sahih isnad.)

You might think his salah is still fine without a correct Fatihah, but **The Prophet (pbuh)** has said: \
A person who does not recite The Fatihah in his salah, it is as though he has not prayed at all! \
`Bukhari 723`

# Aisha and Uthman considered each other kafir!

Uthman told Aisha that she is like the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut, and Aisha would say: O People! This is the shirt of The Prophet of Allah! It has not yet been destroyed, but his Sunnah has been destroyed. \
`Mahsul Razi, vol 4, page 343.`

Uthman said that he will say every "bad thing" that comes to mind to these two "Fitna makers" (Aisha and Hafsa). \
`Musannaf Abd-ur-Razzaq, vol 11, page 356` `Jami Mu'ammar ibn Rashid, vol 11, page 355`

# Aisha as described by The Prophet (pbuh) and Umar

The Prophet (pbuh) pointed at the house of Aisha and said: Fitna is here! Fitna is here! The horn of Satan will rise from here! \
`Bukhari, vol 4, page 82`

The Prophet (pbuh) pointed at the house of Aisha and said: The head of kufr is here, and the horn of Satan will appear here! \
`Muslim, vol 4, page 2229.`

The Prophet (pbuh) told Aisha: I hope it (her death) happens and I would be alive so that I would be able to ask for forgiveness for you! Aisha responded: You just want me to die... \
`Bukhari, vol 9, page 80`

**Aisha:** \
I was jealous of Maria more than any other wife, she was beautiful, she used to be our servant, Allah gave her a child, and deprived me of a child. \
`Tabaqat al Kubra, vol 8, page 212`

**Umar:** \
A mat in a house is better than a woman who cannot have children. \
`Sunan Abi Dawud, vol 2, page 232`

# Surah at-Tahreem and Ayat Ifk blame Aisha and Hafsa

Surah at-Tahreem blames Aisha and Hafsa according to: \
`Bukhari, vol 5, page 4964, hadith 4966`

The ayat of Ifk, the one purifying the wife of The Prophet (pbuh), is not about Aisha being accused, but Maria: \
**Aisha:** \
The Prophet (pbuh) asked me if his son, Ibrahim (son of Maria), looked like him, and I, out of jealousy, said no, and as such, the people spread rumors. \
`Mustadrak, vol 4, page 39` \
Another source, `Muslim, vol 8, page 119`, does not name the wife, but its similarity to this one confirms it. This also shows how much Sunni authors try to protect Aisha!

# Sunnis believe The Quran and Sunnah have been corrupted

**Quran:**

**Aisha:** \
The ayah for stoning someone to death and the ayah for breastfeeding to an elder were under my bed, but a goat came and ate it! \
`Sunan Ibn Majah, vol 6, page 72`

**Aisha:** \
There was an ayah in The Quran saying if a kid drinks a woman's milk 5 times, they become mahram, and this ayah was still in The Quran when The Prophet died. \
`Muslim 3487` \
(It isn't now, so it must be corruption!)

**Umar:** \
The Quran that was given to The Prophet had 11,027,000 letters. \
`Durr ul Manthur, by Suyuti, vol 6, page 422` `Jami us Saghir, by Suyuti, vol 2, page 264` `Itqan as Suyuti, vol 1, page 121` `Mu'jam al Ausat, by Tabarani, vol 6, page 361` `Majma' uz Zawa'id al Haythami, vol 7, page 163` \
(Current Qu'ran has less than 2/3rds of that!)

**Ibn Mas'ud:** \
Surah an-Nas and al-Falaq are not part of The Quran. \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 35, page 117, hadith 21188`

If I was not afraid that the hearts would deviate, I would say the ayat that have been removed in The Quran of Uthman! \
`Kibrit ul Ahmar, page 143`

**Ibn Mas'ud:** \
During the life of The Prophet we would recite (Surah al-Ma'idah, ayah 67) as such: O Messenger! Deliver that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, that Ali is the Maula of Mu'minin, and if you do not, you will not have communicated His message, and Allah shall protect you from the people. Indeed Allah does not guide the faithless lot. \
`Durr ul Manthur, vol 3, page 117`

Our narrations regarding the corruption of The Qur'an are uncountable. \
`Ruh ul Ma'ani, vol 1, page 24`

**Sunnah:**

By Allah! Nothing remains from the Sunnah of Muhammad other than them praying together! \
`Bukhari 622`

I do not see anything remaining of the Sunnah of The Prophet. \
`Bukhari 506`

All of the Sunnah of The Prophet has been destroyed, except salah, but now, that too, has been destroyed. \
`Bukhari 507`

All of the Sunnah of The Prophet have been corrupted, even salah. \
`Al Umm, by Imam Shafi'i, Kitab as-Salat al-Eydayn, vol 1, page 269`

Nothing remains of the Sunnah, other than Adhan. \
`Al Muwatta, by Imam Malik, Kitab as-Salat`

If the Sahaba return, they will not see anything among you of the Sunnnah, other than The Qibla! \
`Jami Bayan al Ilm wa Fadhlah 1453`

# Is Tawassul really shirk?

Bilal went to the grave of The Prophet and said: O Messenger of Allah! The people are perishing from the lack of water! So The Prophet came to him in a dream and said: Go to Umar and give him the news of rain. He did, and Umar cried. \
`Musannaf, vol 11, page 118, hadith 32538` \
(Confirmed by Ibn Kathir, Ibn Hajar, etc.)
