# The consequences of Fatima's anger

**Allah (swt):** \
Indeed, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. \
`Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 57`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Fatima is a part of me and her wrath is my wrath. \
`Bukhari 3714` `Muslim 6202`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Allah gets angry by your anger and gets pleased by your pleasure. \
`Mustadrak, vol 3, page 153`

# Fatima's anger towards Abu Bakr. Could it have been unreasonable?

Abu Bakr told Fatima about the hadith of inheritance, but she never accepted, so we are left with two choices:
1. Fatima was being unreasonable
2. Abu Bakr made it up

If Fatima was an unreasonable person, The Prophet (pbuh) would not have said such wonderful things about her:

**Allah (swt):** \
And he does not speak out of desire. \
`Surah an-Najm, ayah 3`

Now, onto how angry she was with Abu Bakr:

**Fatima:** \
By Allah, I will complain to Allah about you. \
`Ansab al Ashraf, vol 3, page 316` `Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

**Fatima:** \
By Allah, I will not speak to you again. \
`Ansab al Ashraf, vol 3, page 316` `Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

Fatima was angered by Abu Bakr and did not speak to him until her death. \
`Bukhari 3093`

Fatima left in her will that Abu Bakr may not pray upon her, so she was buried nightly, and Abbas ibn Abd-ul-Mutallib prayed. \
`Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

Ali buried Fatima nightly without informing Abu Bakr. \
`Bukhari 4240`

Abu Bakr wrote Fatima a document of ownership over Fadak, Umar saw and asked what it was, and Abu Bakr answered, so Umar said: How are you going to suffice the people if they rise against you? So Umar took it from Fatima and ripped it up. \
`As Sirat ul Halabiyah, vol 3, page 488` `Falak un Nijah fil Imamah was Salah, page 160`

# Abu Bakr couldn't have been the Imam of the time

Fatima never went under the bay'ah of Abu Bakr. If Abu Bakr was the Imam of the time, then that means she died a death of kufr! How can that be, when The Prophet of Allah (pbuh) has said Fatima is a part of her?

Whoever has not recognized the Imam of his time, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Muslim, vol 8, page 107`

Whoever has died, without having an Imam, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 4, page 96` `Mustadrak, vol 1, page 77 and page 117` `Mu'jam al-Kabir, vol 10, page 350, hadith 10687` `Sahih Ibn Haban, number 44`

Whoever has died, and is not under a bay'ah, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Sunan Bayhaqi, vol 8, pages 156-157`

Since Fatima never spoke to Abu Bakr again and said that she will complain to Allah about him, she couldn't have considered him as her Imam. So who was the Imam of Fatima?

# Umar's attack on Fatima

Abu Bakr commanded Umar to bring Ali to him in the worst way possible. \
`Ansab al Ashraf, vol 1, page 587`

Ali and Zubayr were in the house of Fatima, and when the news of this reached Umar, he came and said: O daughter of The Messenger of Allah! The dearest person to us is your father, and after him, you. But, By Allah, this will not prevent me from commanding your house to be set on fire, if this gathering (Ali and Zubayr) is ever repeated. Fatima said: By Allah, he will do what he said. \
`Musannaf, vol 8, page 572`

Umar came to the house of Fatima and said: By Allah, I will set this house on fire if they do not come out and give bay'ah. Zubayr came out with his sword but he slipped and fell and his sword was taken. \
`Tarikh Tabari, vol 2, page 443`

Abu Bakr commanded Umar to take Ali, for bay'ah, Umar went to Fatima's house with a fire. Fatima, from behind the door, asked: O son of Khattab! Is it you who wishes to burn my house down? Umar responded: Yes, this will strengthen what your father brought. \
`Ansab al Ashraf, vol 1, page 586`

Abu Bakr command Umar to take them out of their home, and if they resisted, to go to war with them, Umar went to her house with a flame. Fatima asked: O son of Khattab, is the fire that you have brought, to burn my house down? He said: Yes, unless you do what the Ummah has done. \
`Aqd ul Farid, vol 3, page 63` `Tarikh Abul Fada, vol 1, page 156`

Abu Bakr sent Umar to get bay'ah from those who had rejected him, who were staying at Fatima's house. Umar told them to come out but they rejected. Umar requested firewood and said: By Allah, either come out or I will burn down this house and whoever is inside it. He was told Fatima is inside, he said even if Fatima is inside! \
`A'lam an Nisa, vol 4, page 114`

Umar said: If you do not give bay'ah, I will set the house on fire and I will not free anyone inside it, even if the daughter of The Mustafa is among them! \
`Diwan Muhammad Hafiz Ibrahim, vol 1, page 82`

They set her house on fire and caused Muhsin to be miscarried. \
`Isbat ul Wasiyah, page 143`

On the day of bay'ah, Umar hit Fatima and caused Muhsin to be miscarried.\
`Al Wafi bil Wafiyat, vol 5, page 347`

Umar kicked Fatima and caused Muhsin to be miscarried. \
`Lisan ul Mizan, by Ibn Hajar, vol 1, page 268`
> Ibn Hajar rejects this hadith by saying Ibn Abi Darim, the person who narrated this, is from Rawafidh, but he is described in Siyar A'lam an Nubala (vol 15, page 576 and vol 9, page 555) as being a virtuous Imam with a good memory and all of the six sahih books narrate from him. So either the sahih books aren't actually sahih, or Umar kicked Fatima and caused her to miscarry!

Umar said: By Allah, come out or I will burn this house upon it's residents. He was told Fatima is inside, he said even if Fatima is inside! Umar first knocked, then proceeded to kick the door down. Fatima was yelling out: O father! O Prophet of Allah! \
`Al Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, vol 1, pages 192-193, and vol 4, pages 274-277`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
When I saw Fatima, I remembered an event that will happen to her, her right taken away from her, her ribs broken, her child miscarried, while she is yelling out 'Wa Muhammadah!' (calling out to her father), but no one responds to her. She will be the first of my kinsmen to join me, and she will meet me while she is deeply saddened and martyred. O Allah, curse whoever wronged her, punish who took away her right, and humiliate who has humiliated her, and give eternal hellfire to who shattered her ribs and murdered her unborn child. Angels say Ameen. \
`Fara'id us Simtain, vol 2, pages 34-35`

**Allah (swt):** \
Indeed, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. \
`Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 57`

# Umar's lawat and sodomy!

**Umar:** \
Has not remained anything in me from the time of jahaliyah, except I am not ashamed of being Nikah'd or doing Nikah. \
`Tabaqat al Kubra, vol 3, page 269`

Some people claim nikah here means "taking care" but it's clearly refering to the jihaly way! So it can't be "taking care" or "marriage with the opposite sex" but rather "zina" or "lawat". \
In zina, the man is always the top and the woman is always the bottom, but since Umar is saying he's sometimes the top and sometimes the bottom, he must be talking about lawat and sodomy!

# Umar would condemn The Prophet (pbuh) and would command him to do things another way!

Abu Hurayrah went to The Prophet (pbuh) and The Prophet (pbuh), while giving him his shoes, said: Take this and go, and if you saw anyone saying "La Ilaha Illallah" while he believes it in his heart, tell him that he'll be in Jannah! On his way, he saw Umar, and Umar asked him what the shoes are for, and he said what The Prophet (pbuh) had told him, so Umar hit Abu Hurayrah causing him to fall hard to the ground, and told him to go back. So Abu Hurayrah went back to The Prophet (pbuh) while crying, and he asked him what was wrong, and Abu Hurayrah explained, so The Prophet (pbuh) asked Umar why he did as such, and Umar said: Don't give anyone the good news of Jannah, because they'll think this is enough for them and that they do not need to do good deeds anymore. \
`Muslim, vol 1, page 59`

Umar took The Prophet (pbuh) by his shirt and said: Hasn't Allah forbidden you from praying for Munafiqin? The Prophet (pbuh) ignored him. \
`Muslim, vol 8, page 120`

# Umar would urinate while standing

**Umar:** \
The Prophet (pbuh) saw me while I was urinating while standing, and told me not to do it while standing. \
`Sunan Tirmidhi, vol 1, page 18`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Among the betrayals (to oneself) is to urinate while standing. \
`Umdat ul Qari, vol 3, page 135`

# Umar would disobey The Quran by skipping prayers

**Allah (swt):** \
If you do not find water, then purify yourself with clean dirt. \
`Surah an-Nisa, ayah 43`

**Umar:** \
If I don't find water, I will not pray. \
`Sunan Abi Dawud, vol 1, page 81` `Sunan Nisa'i, vol 1, page 168` `Musannaf, vol 1, pages 238-239` `Sunan al Kubra, vol 1, page 133` `Mu'jam al Kabir, vol 9, page 314` `Umdat ul Qari, vol 4, page 19` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 9, page 588`

# Umar would recite Al-Fatiha incorrectly, even in salah

Correct: __Sirat alladhina__ an'amta alayhim ghayr-il-maghdubi alayhim __wa la-dhallin__ \
Umar would always recite like this: __Sirata man__ an'amta alayhim ghayri-il-maghdhubi alayhim __ghayr-idh-dhallina alayhim wa ghayr-adh-dhallin__ \
`Masahif, by Ibn Abi Dawud, vol 1, pages 284-286` \
(Ibn Abi Dawud and Ibn Athir have said this hadith has sahih isnad.)

You might think his salah is still fine without a correct Fatihah, but **The Prophet (pbuh)** has said: \
A person who does not recite The Fatihah in his salah, it is as though he has not prayed at all! \
`Bukhari 723`

# A few of the bid'ahs of Umar

Umar, regarding Taraweeh: This is a good bid'ah. \
`Bukhari, vol 3, page 45, hadith 2010`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
All bid'ah is misguidance, all misguidance leads to hellfire. \
`Muslim, vol 2, page 592, hadith 867`

Mut'ah was halal during the lifetime of The Prophet (pbuh) and even Abu Bakr, but Umar said that he specifically made it haram! \
`Muslim, vol 2, page 1023` `Sunan al Kubra, vol 7, page 237` `Musnad Ahmad, vol 1, page 52 and vol 3, page 325` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 8, page 293` `Tarikh Madinah Damishq, by Ibn Asakir, vol 64, page 71` `Tahdhib ul Kamal, vol 31, page 214`

Imam Malik and Ibn Abbas believed Mut'ah is halal. \
`Mabsut, vol 5, page 152` `Mustadrak, vol 2, page 334, hadith 3192`

Ibn Jurayj, famous Sunni scholar, also known as Shaykh-ul-Haram and Faqih-ul-Haram, had done Mut'ah with 90 women. \
`Siyar A'lam an Nubala, vol 6, page 333`

Umar commanded "As-Salat khayrun min-an-noum" to be added to the adhan of fajr. \
`Muwatta Imam Malik, vol 1, page 72`

Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas was the first person to say "As-Salat khayrun min-an-noum", but then said it is bid'ah and quit it, and Bilal would not do adhan for Umar. \
`Musannaf, vol 1, page 474`

Ibn Umar heard someone say "As-Salat khayrun min-an-noum" so he said: Take us away from this bid'ah maker! \
`Musannaf, vol 1, page 475. Kanz ul Ummal, vol 8, page 167`

**Abu Hanifah:** \
"As-Salat khayrun min-an-noum" is one of the things that people have created. (which is the definition of bid'ah) \
`Jami ul Masatid Imam A'dham, vol 1, page 296`

# Abu Bakr's caliphate wasn't just controversial

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
After me, whoever disagrees with Ali regarding the caliphate is a kafir! \
`Yanabi ul Mawadda, page 97` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 1, page 209, hadith 1046`

1. Ali, Zubayr and all of Ansar were against Abu Bakr, and only wanted Ali. \
   `Bukhari, vol 6, page 2505` `Tarikh Tabari, vol 2, page 233`
2. Bani Hashim and even Bani Umayyah highly preferred Ali. \
   `Minhaj us Sunnah, by Ibn Tayimiyah, vol 7, page 49`
3. Fatima did not go under the bay'ah of Abu Bakr, and during these 6 months until her death, neither did Ali. \
   `Bukhari, vol 4, page 1549 and page 3998`
4. **Umar:** (My) bay'ah with Abu Bakr (in saqifah, which was the first bay'ah with him) was a miscalculation, but Allah saved us from its disaster. If someone tries to do something like this ever again, kill him. \
   `Bukhari, vol 6, page 2505`
5. Umar had to go as far as setting the house of Fatima on fire to strengthen Abu Bakr's position \
   [As previously mentioned.](#umars-attack-on-fatima)
6. **Prophet (pbuh):** Pray behind any good or evil person. \
   `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 5, page 54, hadith 14815` `Fiqh ala Madhahib Arba'a, vol 1, pages 409-428`

# Abu Bakr and Umar, are they the examples for the Ummah to follow?

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Whoever takes leadership over a group of Muslims while he knows there is better than him, he has betrayed Allah, His Messenger, and Muslims. \
`Tamhid ul Awa'il wa Talkhis ud Dala'il, vol 1, page 486`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
The best of you is the best to his family, and I am the best to my family. \
`Sunan Ibn Majah, vol 1, page 636, hadith 1977`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
The best of you is the best to his wives. \
`Sunan Ibn Majah, vol 1, page 636, hadith 1978`

**Aisha:** \
The Prophet (pbuh) never hit anything with his hand, not a wife, nor a servant. \
`Muslim, vol 4, page 1814, hadith 2328`

Ash'ath ibn Qays said that he was invited over to Umar's house, and he beat up his wife. \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 1, page 20, hadith 122` `Mustadark, vol 4, page 194` `Sunan Ibn Majah, vol 1, page 639, hadith 1986` `Tahdhib ul Kamal, vol 18, page 31` `Tafsir Quran Adhim Ibn Kathir, vol 1, page 493`

**Allah (swt):** \
Say, is he who guides others superior, or he who won't be guided unless by others. \
`Surah ay-Yunus, ayah 35`

**Umar:** \
If not for Ali, Umar would have perished and gone astray! \
`Sharh Nahj ul-Balagha, by Ibn Abil Hadid, vol 1, page 18, and vol 12, page 179` `Yanabi ul Mawadda, vol 1, page 216, and vol 2, page 172, and vol 3, page 147` `Ta'wil Mukhtalif al Hadith, by Ibn Qutaybah, vol 1, page 162` `Tafsir Sam'ani, vol 5, page 154`

Umar would seek refuge in Allah out of fear of Ali not being present to solve any of his future problems. \
`Fat-h ul Bari, by Ibn Hajar, vol 13, page 286`

**Umar:** \
Everyone is more knowledgeable than Umar. \
`Sunan al Kubra, vol 7, page 380`

Umar did not allow hadiths from The Prophet (pbuh) to be said, or even tafsir of The Quran. \
`Sunan Ibn Majah, vol 1, page 12` `Mustadrak, vol 1, page 183` `Tabaqat al Kubra, vol 6, page 87` `Sunan Darimi, vol 1, page 329`

Umar incarcerated three people for sharing hadith, among which is Ibn Mas'ud. \
`Tadhkirat ul Huffadh, by Dhahabi, vol 1, page 7` `Majma uz Zawa'id, by Haythami, vol 1, page 149`

Someone asked Umar a question about The Quran so Umar incarcerated him and hit him on several occasions, breaking his skull, before finally releasing him, and he sent people to go after him and shout: He wanted knowledge but it was a mistake! \
`Sunan Darimi, vol 1, pages 66-67, hadiths 144-148` `Tafsir al Kabir, vol 23, page 128` `Musannaf, vol 11, page 426` `Tafsir Quran Adhim, by Ibn Kathir, vol 2, page 283` `Tarikh Madinah Damishq, by Ibn Asakir, vol 23, pages 411-412`

**Abu Bakr:** \
I have become your Caliph while I am not the best of you. \
`Bidayah wan Nihayah, vol 7, page 6`

**Abu Bakr:** \
I am not the best of you while Ali is among you. \
`Sharh Nahj ul Balagha, by Ibn Abil Hadid, vol 1, page 169`

Abu Bakr and wanted to return the Caliphate to Ali, but Umar denied him from doing that. \
`Tarikh Tabari, vol 2, page 236`

# Abu Bakr and Umar kept drinking, especially Umar

Umar would drink even after it became haram, and when the news of this reached The Prophet (pbuh), he angrily went to Umar and hit him with what was in his hand, and the ayah 91 of Surah al-Ma'idah was revealed. "...Will you not then abstain?" and Umar said we will abstain. (He did not.) \
`Rabi ul Abrar, vol 5, page 10`

Abu Bakr and Umar would drink even after it became haram. \
`Fat-h ul Bari, by Ibn Hajar, vol 10, page 37` `Sunan al Kubra, vol 8, page 519`

Umar would drink during his Caliphate. \
`Musannaf, vol 6, p502` `Sunan Bayhaqi, vol 8, page 299` `Mawatta Imam Malik, vol 2, page 894` `Istidhkar, vol 8, page 247` `Sunan Daruqutni, vol 4, page 259` `Bada'i us Sana'i, vol 5, page 116` `Jami ul Masatid Abu Hanifa, vol 2, page 192` `Mabsut, vol 24, pages 8-11` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 5, page 522`

Famous scholar, Alusi, said that after that ayah, alcoholic beverages were still not really haram, since sahaba would engage in it. \
`Ruh ul Ma'ani, by Alusi, vol 1, page 509` `Tafsir Qurtubi, vol 3, page 60`

Umar even drank on his deathbed! \
`Tarikh Madinah Damishq, by Ibn Asakir, vol 44, page 430`

# Abu Bakr and Umar wished they were feces but never human!

**Abu Bakr:** \
Lucky you, O bird! You eat fruits and sit on trees, and you will not have Hisab, nor Iqab. I wish I too was on a tree and a camel passing by would eat me and I would come out alongisde its feces, and I was never human! \
`Musannaf, vol 7, page 91` `Minhaj us Sunnah, by Ibn Tayimiyah, vol 3, page 120` `Tarikh ul Khulafa, by Suyuti, page 142` `Riyadh un Nadharah, vol 1, page 134` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 12, page 528`

**Abu Bakr:** \
Lucky you, O bird! You eat fruits and fly through trees, and you will not have Hisab, nor Iqab. By Allah I swear, I wish I was a ram, and my family would fatten me to the point that I would be the fattest ram, then they would behead me and make food with me, and eat me, and in the end I would come out as feces, and I was never created as a human! \
`Kanz ul Ummal, vol 12, page 528`

**Umar:** \
I wish I was a sheep belonging to my family, so that they would fatten me, and when they get an important guest, they would behead me, and make food with me, and eat me, and in the end I would come out as feces, and I was never a person! \
`Tarikh Madinah Damishq, by Ibn Asakir, vol 30, page 331, and vol 50, page 172` `Minhaj us Sunnah, by Ibn Tayimiyah, vol 3, page 131` `Jami ul Ahadith, by Suyuti, vol 13, page 312` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 12, page 619`

# Hearts of Satan despite their human bodies

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
After me, Imams will rule over you, who have not been guided by my guidance, and do not follow my Sunnah. Very soon, men among them will rule, their hearts are the hearts of Satan and their bodies are human! \
`Muslim, vol 3, page 1476`

**The Prophet (pbuh)** told Abu Bakr: Indeed, Shirk is hidden inside you. Abu Bakr asked: Is shirk other than worshipping other than Allah? The Prophet (pbuh) repeated: By him, who my life is in the hand of, shirk is hidden within you! \
`Adab ul Farid, by Bukhari, page 243, number 726`

**Abu Hanifa:** \
Abu Bakr and Iblis have equal Imaan. \
`Sunnah, vol 1, page 219`

# Uthman in Umar's wording

Umar saying "If not for Ali, Umar would have perished and gone astray" was after Ali prevented him from commanding a woman to be stoned to death who did not deserve it. \
Uthman commanded a woman to be stoned to death, and Ali explained, so Uthman retreated his commanded, but by the time the commander of Uthman reached the woman to inform people about Uthman's retreat, she was already killed. \
And this is how Uthman has perished and gone astray, in Umar's wording! \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 1, page 104` `Muwatta Imam Malik, vol 2, page 825` `Sunan Bayhaqi, vol 7, page 442` `Durr ul Manthur, regarding the ayah "and we advised human to be good to his parents"` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 3, page 227`

# How the "righteous" Salaf treated Uthman

Uthman's corpse was rotting among trash for days and no one cared, on the 4th night, his cousin, Marwan ibn Hakam, and 11 others, none of which were from the sahaba, gathered to take him to a graveyard, but someone said: By Allah! If you bury him here, I will inform the people so that they would come and dig him up! So they took him to a Jewish graveyard, and he was buried there. \
`Istee'ab, vol 3, page 80`

Muawiya commanded the wall separating Baqi and that Jewish graveyard to be broken and to keep burying Muslims near him until his grave was connected to Baqi. \
`Tarikh Tabari, vol 2, page 687`

This shows how little Ali and other sahaba cared about Uthman, they did nothing for him.

# Uthman and Aisha considered each other kafir

Uthman told Aisha that she is like the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut, and Aisha would say: O People! This is the shirt of The Prophet of Allah (pbuh)! It has not yet been destroyed, but his Sunnah has been destroyed. \
`Mahsul Razi, vol 4, page 343.`

Uthman said that he will say every "bad thing" that comes to mind to these two "Fitna makers" (Aisha and Hafsa). \
`Musannaf Abd-ur-Razzaq, vol 11, page 356` `Jami Mu'ammar ibn Rashid, vol 11, page 355`

# Aisha as described by The Prophet (pbuh) and Umar

The Prophet (pbuh) pointed at the house of Aisha and said: Fitna is here! Fitna is here! The horn of Satan will rise from here! \
`Bukhari, vol 4, page 82`

The Prophet (pbuh) pointed at the house of Aisha and said: The head of kufr is here, and the horn of Satan will appear here! \
`Muslim, vol 4, page 2229.`

The Prophet (pbuh) told Aisha: I hope it (her death) happens and I would be alive so that I would be able to ask for forgiveness for you! Aisha responded: You just want me to die... \
`Bukhari, vol 9, page 80`

**Aisha:** \
I was jealous of Maria more than any other wife, she was beautiful, she used to be our servant, Allah gave her a child, and deprived me of a child. \
`Tabaqat al Kubra, vol 8, page 212`

**Umar:** \
A mat in a house is better than a woman who cannot have children. \
`Sunan Abi Dawud, vol 2, page 232`

# The Quran repeatedly blames Aisha and Hafsa

Surah at-Tahreem blames Aisha and Hafsa according to: \
`Bukhari, vol 5, page 4964, hadith 4966`

The 11th ayah of Surah al-Hujurat, saying "...And do not let some women ridicule others, they may be better than them..." was revealed after Aisha and Hafsa ridiculed Umm Salama. \
`Ruh ul Ma'ani, by Alusi, vol 6, page 152` `Jami li Ahkam Quran, by Qurtubi, vol 16, page 326` `Tafsir Maqatil Sulayman, vol 3, page 262`

The ayat of Ifk, the one purifying the wife of The Prophet (pbuh), is not about Aisha being accused, but Maria: \
**Aisha:** \
The Prophet (pbuh) asked me if his son, Ibrahim (son of Maria), looked like him, and I, out of jealousy, said no, and as such, the people spread rumors. \
`Mustadrak, vol 4, page 39` \
Another source, `Muslim, vol 8, page 119`, does not name the wife, but its similarity to this one confirms it. This also shows how much Sunni authors try to protect Aisha!

# Aisha's arrogance to The Prophet (pbuh)

**Allah (swt):** \
O Believers! Do not speak louder than The Messenger like how you speak with one another, or your deeds will be void while you do not realize. \
`Surah al-Hajarat, ayah 2`

Aisha yelled at The Prophet (pbuh): I have now realized that you love Ali more than me and my father! And she repeated herself. \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 30, pages 372-373` `Sunan Abi Dawud, vol 4, page 300` `Sunan al Kubra, vol 7, page 488` `Fat-h ul Bari, vol 7, page 27`

There are other instances of Aisha yelling at The Prophet (pbuh), refer to: \
`Sunan Abi Dawud, vol 4, page 300`

**Aisha:** \
I was laying down close to The Prophet (pbuh) praying, whenever he would do Sijda, he would squeeze my foot (to remind her that it's impolite to lay down with your feet pointing at him), and I would retreat my legs, and when he stood up, I would point them again. \
`Bukhari, vol 1, page 86 and page 108`

**Aisha:** \
One night, The Prophet (pbuh) went out, and I got jealous (afraid that he would spend my night with someone else) and when The Prophet (pbuh) returned and saw me, he asked me if I got jealous, and I said: How would I not be jealous with someone like you? \
`Muslim, vol 4, page 2169`

**Aisha:** \
The Prophet (pbuh) gestured to us not to feed him medicine, but since sick people hate medicine, we fed him anyway. He later told us: Everyone in the house should be fed this 'medicine' except Abbas who was not present to see what you were up to. \
`Bukhari, vol 4, page 1618, hadith 4189`

**Allah (swt):** \
And he does not speak out of desire. \
`Surah an-Najm, ayah 3`

One day, The Prophet (pbuh) said the name of Khadijah (in his talks), so Aisha said: \
Do I look like I have to do anything with her? She was but a weak old woman, Allah has given you better. The Prophet (pbuh) became so angry that the hair on his head was standing. \
`Bukhari, vol 5, page 39` `Muslim, vol 4, page 1889` (Similar occasions: `Musnad Ahmad, vol 41, page 356` `Bukhari, vol 3, page 1389` `Muslim, vol 4, page 1889`)

**Allah (swt):** \
Indeed, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. \
`Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 57`

# The consequences of hating Ali. Aisha did for Ali what Muawiya did for Hasan

Aisha was delighted to hear the news of the death of Ali and performed Sijda. \
`Tabaqat al Kubra, vol 3, page 40` `Tarikh Tabari, vol 3, page 159`

Aisha disliked saying the name of Ali: \
Aisha said: When the sickness of The Prophet (pbuh) worsened, he would be carried around by Abbas and another person, while his feet would touch the ground. Ibn Abbas asked Ubaydullah: Do you know who that other person was? Ubaydullah said no. Ibn Abbas said: He was Ali ibn Abi Talib. \
`Bukhari, vol 1, page 83`

Aisha could not think of Ali nicely. \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 6, page 228, hadith 25956` `Fat-h ul Bari, by Ibn Hajar, vol 2, page 156` `Umdat ul Qari, vol 5, page 192`

**Abu Bakr:** \
I saw The Prophet (pbuh), Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn under a tent, he said: O Muslims! I surrender to who surrenders to the people of the tent. I will be at war with who goes to war with them. No one loves us except blessed people born of pure marriage. No one hates us except miserable people born of Zina. \
`Riyadh un Nadharah, vol 2, page 489`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Whoever fights against Ali is kafir and belongs to hell. \
`Yanabi ul Mawadda, vol 2, page 275, hadith 789`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
If my Ummah pray and fast so much that they become as thin as a bow but they are against you, Allah will throw them into hellfire. \
`Fara'id us Simtain, vol 1, page 51, hadith 16` `Tarikh Madinah Damishq, by Ibn Asakir, vol 1, page 145, hadith 179`

Muawiya was delighted to hear the news of Hasan's death and performed Sijda. (Exactly what Aisha did for Ali!) \
`Mukhtasar fi Akhbar al Bashar, by Abul Fada, vol 1, page 183`

Aisha, Talha and Zubayr carried out the war of Jamal against Ali.

# Did Aisha really own the house?

If Aisha did not own the house of The Prophet (pbuh) in which he was buried, then who was she to allow Abu Bakr and Umar to be buried next to him but not Hasan? \
If Aisha did own the house, then she either received it as Mihriya (payment to wife as part of marriage) or inheritance. \
It cannot be inheritance because she testified to the favor of Abu Bakr that prophets do not leave inheritance. \
It cannot be Mihriya either because The Quran (Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 50) has said the wives of The Prophet (pbuh) are halal for him (which wouldn't be the case for an unpaid wife). \
`Siyar A'lam an Nubala, vol 2, page 605`

**Aisha:** \
This is my house and I will not allow. \
`Tarikh Ya'qubi, vol 2, page 225`

# Sunnis believe The Quran and Sunnah have been corrupted!

**Quran:**

**Aisha:** \
The ayah for stoning someone to death and the ayah for breastfeeding to an elder were under my bed, but a goat came and ate it! \
`Sunan Ibn Majah, vol 6, page 72`

**Aisha:** \
There was an ayah in The Quran saying if a kid drinks a woman's milk 5 times, they become mahram, and this ayah was still in The Quran when The Prophet (pbuh) died. \
`Muslim 3487` \
(It isn't now, so it must be corruption!)

**Umar:** \
The Quran that was given to The Prophet (pbuh) had 11,027,000 letters. \
`Durr ul Manthur, by Suyuti, vol 6, page 422` `Jami us Saghir, by Suyuti, vol 2, page 264` `Itqan as Suyuti, vol 1, page 121` `Mu'jam al Ausat, by Tabarani, vol 6, page 361` `Majma uz Zawa'id, by Haythami, vol 7, page 163` \
(Current Qu'ran has less than 2/3rds of that!)

**Ibn Mas'ud:** \
Surah an-Nas and al-Falaq are not part of The Quran. \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 35, page 117, hadith 21188`

If I was not afraid that the hearts would deviate, I would say the ayat that have been removed in The Quran of Uthman! \
`Kibrit ul Ahmar, page 143`

**Ibn Mas'ud:** \
During the life of The Prophet (pbuh) we would recite (Surah al-Ma'idah, ayah 67) as such: O Messenger! Deliver that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, that Ali is the Maula of Mu'minin, and if you do not, you will not have communicated His message, and Allah shall protect you from the people. Indeed Allah does not guide the faithless lot. \
`Durr ul Manthur, vol 3, page 117`

Our narrations regarding the corruption of The Quran are uncountable. \
`Ruh ul Ma'ani, vol 1, page 24`

**Sunnah:**

By Allah! Nothing remains from the Sunnah of Muhammad other than them praying together! \
`Bukhari 622`

I do not see anything remaining of the Sunnah of The Prophet (pbuh). \
`Bukhari 506`

All of the Sunnah of The Prophet (pbuh) has been destroyed, except salah, but now, that too, has been destroyed. \
`Bukhari 507`

All of the Sunnah of The Prophet (pbuh) have been corrupted, even salah. \
`Al Umm, by Imam Shafi'i, Kitab as-Salat al-Eydayn, vol 1, page 269`

Nothing remains of the Sunnah, other than Adhan. \
`Al Muwatta, by Imam Malik, Kitab as-Salat`

If the Sahaba return, they will not see anything among you of the Sunnnah, other than The Qibla! \
`Jami Bayan al Ilm wa Fadhlah 1453`

# Is Tawassul really shirk?

Bilal went to the grave of The Prophet (pbuh) and said: O Messenger of Allah! The people are perishing from the lack of water! So The Prophet (pbuh) came to him in a dream and said: Go to Umar and give him the news of rain. He did, and Umar cried. \
`Musannaf, vol 11, page 118, hadith 32538` \
(Confirmed by Ibn Kathir, Ibn Hajar, etc.)

Abu Hanifah was a servant of the shrine of Imam Ja'far Sadiq and would ask for his help when he was burdened. \
`Radd Wahhabi, page 34`

# Shia wudhu and salah are Sunnah

The Prophet (pbuh)'s and Ali's wudhu: \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 2, page 139 and vol 3, page 291` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 9, page 448` `Musnad at-Tialasi, hadith 139`

The Prophet (pbuh) would sometimes pray Dhuhr and Asr together and Maghrib and Isha together. \
`Sahih Muslim, vol 1, page 489, and hadith 327` `Musnad Ahmad, vol 3, page 280, hadith 1918 and vol 3, page 283, hadith 1929` `Sunan Abi Dawud, vol 2, page 6`

**Ibn Abbas:** \
The Prophet (pbuh) did as such while he was not worried of anything nor was there rain. \
`Muslim, vol 1, page 490` `Sunan Tirmidhi, vol 1, page 354, hadith 187` `Sunan Abi Dawud, vol 2, page 6, hadith 1211` `Sunan Nisa'i, vol 1, page 315, hadith 601` `Musnad Ahmad, vol 5, page 81, hadith 3235`

**Imam Malik:** \
The Sunnah is to pray without holding your hands. \
`Tuhfat ul Fuqaha, vol 1, page 126`

# Taqiyyah is a part of Islam

It's worth noting that Taqiyah is specifically about being threatened to get killed if you don't claim to have quit Islam.

**Allah (swt):** \
Those who become kafer after their belief, except those who are forced, while their heart is believing. \
`Surah an-Nahl, ayah 106`

**Allah (swt):** \
And a believer from the kinsmen of Fir'oun who was hiding his belief, said: ... \
`Surah al-Ghafir, ayah 28`

He who does not have Taqiyyah, does not have belief. \
`Musannaf, vol 6, page 474, hadith 33045` `Kanz ul Ummal, vol 3, page 43, hadith 5665`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Allah has taken away from my Ummah, (the punishment of) errors, forgetting, and what is forced. \
`Sunan Ibn Majah, vol 1, page 659`

**Abu Hurayrah:** \
I know hadiths that I could not say during the time of Umar or else he would behead me! \
`Tarikh Madinah Damishq, by Ibn Asakir, vol 67, page 343` `Siyar A'lam an Nubala, vol 2, page 601` `Bidayah wan Nihayah, vol 8, page 107`

**Ibn Mas'ud:** \
If I can escape one lash (of a whip) by saying something, I will say it. \
`Mahali Ibn Hazm, vol 8, page 336`

If a murderer asks about the location of a person, or a thief asks about the location of a thing, not only is it halal to say "I don't know" but it is wajib! \
`Sharh an Nabawi ala Sahih Muslim, vol 15, page 124 and vol 16, page 158`

# Why didn't Ali take Fadak back?

Even after conquering Mecca, The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) did not take back what was taken from him and the Muslims.

Imam Sadiq: \
We are a family who do not take back what is taken from us.

Imam Kadhim: \
Our wali is Allah and he brings us justice. We are the wali of people and we bring them justice. But we do not avenge ourselves.

Imam Sadiq: \
Because the usurpers and the victim had died, the usurpers have been punished and the victim has been rewarded, as such, Ali did not wish to undo their mistake.

Even if this wasn't the case, Ali still wouldn't take back Fadak because the majority of people would be against it, the same way he was generally against Taraweeh but didn't deny those who wanted to pray it, the same way he chose Malik Ashtar but people chose Abu Musa Ash'ari.

People picked an Imam for Taraweeh despite Ali being against it, when the news of this reached him, he sent Hasan to advise them against it, so the people yelled out: Oh God! They wish to destroy the sunnah of Umar! \
`Sharh Nahj ul Balagha, by Ibn Abil Hadid, vol 12, page 282`

# Obeying Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn, in The Quran

**Allah (swt):** \
Indeed, Allah only wants to remove impurity from you, O Ahl al Bayt! And purify you thoroughly. \
`Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 33`

First, we'll discuss who this ayah is about, then it's implications. \
Some claim that because the Ahl al Bayt of Ibrahim included his wife, then the Ahl al Bayt of The Prophet (pbuh) must as well, but that isn't necessarily true. \
Some claim that because the context of the verse is calling upon the wives, then this part must be about them as well, but if you take a look at authentic Sunni sources (see below) you'd realize that's just a misinterpretation of The Quran.

When the ayah of purification was revealed in the house of Umm Salama, The Prophet (pbuh) gathered Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn under the cloak and then recited: \
Indeed, Allah only wants to remove impurity from you, O Ahl al Bayt! And purify you thoroughly. \
Then Umm Salama asked: O Prophet! Am I one of you? The Prophet (pbuh) responded: You are on the path of the righteous (and that is enough for you). \
`Sunan Tirmidhi, vol 5, page 351`

**Aisha:** \
The Prophet (pbuh), Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn gathered under a cloak, then The Prophet (pbuh) recited: \
Indeed, Allah only wants to remove impurity from you, O Ahl al Bayt! And purify you thoroughly. \
`Muslim, vol 7, page 130`

Whenever The Prophet (pbuh) entered the house of Fatima, he would say: \
Assalam alaykum Ahl al Bayt wa rahmatullah wa barakatuh \
Then, he would recite the ayah of purification. \
`Majma uz Zawa'id, by Haytham, vol 9, page 169`

Whenever The Prophet (pbuh) passed by the house of Fatima, he would recite the ayah of purification three times. \
`Shawahid ut Tanzil, vol 2, page 20`

And there are many more hadiths like this! Now, onto the implications:

If someone tells you that something is wajib, or that something is haram, and The Quran has purified them from lying, then obeying them is in reality just obeying Allah.

Additionally, Allah has two types of will. Tashri'i will, which basically means "I want this to happen, but whether or not is will is up to you" and Takwini will, which means "I want this to happen, and it will happen, for am I all powerful." Now, Allah wants us all to be purified, not just the Ahl al Bayt, otherwise he wouldn't have given us Islamic laws to follow, but that's just Tashri'i, meaning it's upto us to do what Allah wants or not, to be purified or not, so when Allah says he ONLY wants to purify Ahl al Bayt, it's clearly not talking about Tashri'i will, but Takwini will, meaning there is no doubt in the purification of Ahl al Bayt!

Allah has said a similar thing about the Sahaba, "And He sent down rain from the sky to purify you, free you from Satan's whispers, strengthen your hearts, and make your steps firm." But since they aren't part of the Ahl al Bayt, then their purification isn't Takwini and guaranteed, but rather Tashri'i and up to them to follow or not. Shia interprets this "water" as being Ahl al Bayt, claiming the Sahaba have been given the chance of purification through the Ahl al Bayt.
