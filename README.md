# The severity of Fatimah's anger

**Allah (swt):** \
Indeed, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. \
`Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 57`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Fatimah is a part of me and her wrath is my wrath. \
`Bukhari 3714` `Muslim 6202`

**The Prophet (pbuh):** \
Allah gets angry by your anger and gets pleased by your pleasure. \
`Mustadrak, vol 3, page 153`

# Fatimah's anger towards Abu Bakr. Could it have been unreasonable?

Abu Bakr told Fatimah about the hadith of inheritance, but she never accepted, so we are left with two choices:
1. Fatimah was being unreasonable
2. Abu Bakr made it up

If Fatimah was an unreasonable person, The Prophet (pbuh) would not have said such wonderful things about her:

**Allah (swt):** \
And he does not speak out of desire. \
`Surah an-Najm, ayah 3`

Now, onto how angry she was with Abu Bakr:

**Fatimah:** \
By Allah, I will complain to Allah about you. \
`Ansab al-Ashraf, vol 3, page 316` `Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

**Fatimah:** \
By Allah, I will not speak to you again. \
`Ansab al-Ashraf, vol 3, page 316` `Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

Fatimah was angered by Abu Bakr and did not speak to him until her death. \
`Bukhari 3093`

Fatimah left in her will that Abu Bakr may not pray upon her, so she was buried nightly, and Abbas ibn Abd-ul-Mutallib prayed. \
`Saqifah wa Fadak, page 104`

Ali buried Fatimah nightly without informing Abu Bakr. \
`Bukhari 4240`

Abu Bakr wrote a document of ownership over Fadak for Fatimah, Umar saw and asked what it was, and Abu Bakr answered, so Umar said: How are you going to suffice the people if they rise against you? So Umar took it from Fatimah and ripped it apart.
`As Sirat ul Halabiyah, vol 3, page 488` `Falak un Nijah fil Imamah was Salah, page 160`

# Abu Bakr couldn't have been the Imam of the time

Fatimah never went under the bay'ah of Abu Bakr. If Abu Bakr was the Imam of the time, then that means she died a death of kufr! How can that be, when The Prophet of Allah (pbuh) has said Fatimah is a part of her?

Whoever has not recognized the Imam of his time, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Muslim, vol 8, page 107`

Whoever has died, without having an Imam, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Musnad Ahmad, vol 4, page 96` `Mustadrak, vol 1, page 77 and page 117` `Mu'jam al-Kabir, vol 10, page 350, hadith 10687` `Sahih Ibn Haban, number 44`

Whoever has died, and is not under a bay'ah, has died a death of jahaliyah. \
`Sunan Bayhaqi, vol 8, page 156-157`

Since Fatimah never spoke to Abu Bakr again and said that she will complain to Allah about him, she couldn't have considered him as her Imam. So who was the Imam of Fatimah?

# Umar's attack on Fatimah

Ali and Zubayr were in the house of Fatimah, and when the news of this reached Umar, he came and said: O daughter of The Messenger of Allah! The dearest person to us is your father, and after him, you. But, By Allah, this will not prevent me from commanding your house to be set on fire, if this gathering (Ali and Zubayr) is ever repeated. Fatimah said: By Allah, he will do what he said."
`Musannaf, vol 8, page 572`

Umar came to the house of Fatimah and said: By Allah, I will set this house on fire if they do not come out and give bay'ah. Zubayr came out with his sword but he slipped and fell and his sword was taken.
`Tarikh Tabari, vol 2, page 443`

Abu Bakr commanded Umar to take Ali, for bay'ah, Umar went to Fatimah's house with a fire. Fatimah, from behind the door, asked: O son of Khattab! Is it you who wishes to burn my house down? Umar responded: Yes, this will strengthen what your father brought.
`Ansab al-Ashraf, vol 1, page 586`

Abu Bakr command Umar to take them out of their home, and if they resisted, to go to war with them, Umar went to her house with a flame. Fatimah asked: O son of Khattab, is the fire that you have brought, to burn my house down? He said: Yes, unless you do what the Ummah has done.
`Aqd ul Farid, vol 3, page 63` `Tarikh Abul Fada, vol 1, page 156`

Abu Bakr sent Umar to get bay'ah from those who had rejected him, who were staying at Fatimah's house. Umar told them to come out but they rejected. Umar requested firewood and said: By Allah, either come out or I will burn down this house and whoever is inside it. He was told Fatimah is inside, he said even if Fatimah is inside!
`A'lam an Nisa, vol 4, page 114`

Umar said: If you do not give bay'ah, I will set the house on fire and I will not free anyone inside it, even if the daughter of The Mustafa is among them!
`Diwan Muhammad Hafiz Ibrahim, vol 1, page 82`

They set her house on fire and caused Muhsin to be miscarried.
`Isbat ul Wasiyah, page 143`

On the day of bay'ah, Umar hit Fatimah and caused Muhsin to be miscarried.
`Al Wafi bil Wafiyat, vol 5, page 347`

Umar kicked Fatimah and caused Muhsin to be miscarried.
`Lisan ul Mizan, by Ibn Hajar, vol 1, page 268`
> Ibn Hajar rejects this hadith by saying Ibn Abi Darim, the person who narrated this, is from Rawafidh, but he is described in Siyar A'lam an Nubala (vol 15, page 576 and vol 9, page 555) as being a virtuous Imam with a good memory and all of the six sahih books narrate from him. So either the sahih books aren't actually sahih, or Umar caused Fatimah to miscarry!

Umar said: By Allah, come out or I will burn this house upon it's residents. He was told Fatimah is inside, he said even if Fatimah is inside! Umar first knocked, then proceeded to kick the door down. Fatimah was yelling out: O father! O Prophet of Allah!
`Al Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, vol 1, page 192-193, and vol 4, page 274-277`

**The Prophet (pbuh):**
When I saw Fatimah, I remembered an event that will happen to her, her right taken away from her, her ribs broken, her child miscarried, while she is yelling out 'Wa Muhammadah!' (calling out to her father), but no one responds to her. She will be the first of my kinsmen to join me, and she will meet me while she is deeply saddened and martyred. O Allah, curse whoever wronged her, punish who took away her right, and humiliate who has humiliated her, and give eternal hellfire to who shattered her ribs and murdered her unborn child. Angels say Ameen.
`Fara'id us Simtain, vol 2, page 34-35`

**Allah (swt):** \
Indeed, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. \
`Surah al-Ahzab, ayah 57`

# Umar would condemn The Prophet (pbuh) and would command him to do things another way

Abu Hurayrah went to The Prophet (pbuh) and The Prophet (pbuh), while giving him his shoes, said: Take this and go, and if you saw anyone saying "La Ilaha Illallah" while he believes it in his heart, tell him that he'll be in Jannah! On his way, he saw Umar, and Umar asked him what the shoes are for, and he said what The Prophet (pbuh) had told him, so Umar hit Abu Hurayrah causing him to fall hard to the ground, and told him to go back. So Abu Hurayrah went back to The Prophet (pbuh) while crying, and he asked him what was wrong, and Abu Hurayrah explained, so The Prophet (pbuh) asked Umar why he did as such, and Umar said: Don't give anyone the good news of Jannah, because they'll think this is enough for them and that they do not need to do good deeds anymore.
`Muslim, vol 1, page 59`

Umar took The Prophet (pbuh) by his shirt and said: Hasn't Allah forbidden you from praying for Munafiqin? The Prophet (pbuh) ignored him.
`Muslim, vol 8, page 120`
